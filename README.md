# Testing Utility ModuleScript Suite

This repository features a set of ModuleScripts designed to provide basic function testing
and runtime debugging.

These ModuleScripts are designed to hopefully be lightweight and flexible for use.

## Main directory
This directory contains one lone ModuleScript.

## Subdirectory: RandomValue
This sub-directory contains a ModuleScript with functions to generate random values
within different parameter ranges and of different data types.

More Info: [RandomValue](./RandomValue)

## Subdirectory: FunctionTest
This sub-directory contains three ModuleScripts with functions to test function behaviour
according to their return values and mutations to input parameters.

More Info: [FunctionTest](./FunctionTest)

## Subdirectory: Demonstrations
This sub-directory contains ModuleScripts with examples of how the other testing modules
should be used. Currently, examples for FunctionTest and RandomValue are included.

More Info: [Demonstrations](./Demonstrations)

## Subdirectory: RuntimeDebug
This sub-directory contains ModuleScripts with functions designed for in-studio and/or
in-game runtime debugging.

More Info: [RuntimeDebug](./RuntimeDebug/)
